# Question 4

The course policy on the use of artificial intelligence is based on two guiding principles: (1)
Cognitive dimension and (2) Ethical dimension. Briefly describe what each dimension
means.

1. The course policy on the Cognitive dimension of artificial intelligence states that:

"Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice
using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning."

This means that when using AI a student should be learning and understanding the material. Simply copying and pasting AI produced material does not facilitate learning.

2. The course policy on the Ethical dimension of artificial intelligence states that:

"Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity"

Practically, students are required to cite any use of AI in the production of code, and students are not permitted to use AI to produce narrative. Students should also comply with all Duke Acadmeic Policies regarding academic integrity.
